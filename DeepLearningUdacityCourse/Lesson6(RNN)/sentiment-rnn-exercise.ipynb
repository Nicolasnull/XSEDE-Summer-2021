However, it's good enough to just have an embedding layer and let the network learn a different embedding table on its own. *In this case, the embedding layer is for dimensionality reduction, rather than for learning semantic representations.*\n\n>**After input words are passed to an embedding layer, the new embeddings will be passed to LSTM cells.** The LSTM cells will add *recurrent* connections to the network and give us the ability to include information about the *sequence* of words in the movie review data. \n\n>**Finally, the LSTM outputs will go to a sigmoid output layer.** We're using a sigmoid function because positive and negative = 1 and 0, respectively, and a sigmoid will output predicted, sentiment values between 0-1. \n\nWe don't care about the sigmoid outputs except for the **very last one**; we can ignore the rest.

A good `seq_length`, in this case, is 200.\n\n> **Exercise:** Define a function that returns an array `features` that contains the padded data, of a standard size, that we'll pass to the network. \n* The data should come from `review_ints`, since we want to feed integers to the network. \n* Each row should be `seq_length` elements long. \n* For reviews shorter than `seq_length` words, **left pad** with 0s. That is, if the review is `['best', 'movie', 'ever']`, `[117, 18, 128]` as integers, the row will look like `[0, 0, 0, ..., 0, 117, 18, 128]`. \n* For reviews longer than `seq_length`, use only the first `seq_length` words as the feature vector.\n\nAs a small example, if the `seq_length=10` and an input review is: \n```\n[117, 18, 128]\n```\nThe resultant, padded sequence should be: \n\n```\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 117, 18, 128]\n```\n\n**Your final `features` array should be a 2D array, with as many rows as there are reviews, and as many columns as the specified `seq_length`.**\n\nThis isn't trivial and there are a bunch of ways to do this. But, if you're going to be building your own deep learning networks, you're going to have to get used to preparing your data.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def pad_features(reviews_ints, seq_length):\n    ''' Return features of review_ints, where each review is padded with 0's \n        or truncated to the input seq_length.\n    '''\n    ## implement function\n    features = np.zeros((len(reviews_ints), seq_length), dtype = int)\n    \n    for i, row in enumerate(reviews_ints):\n        features[i, -len(row):] = np.array(row)[:seq_length]\n            \n    return features","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-03T18:32:55.808716Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-03T18:32:55.809246Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-03T18:32:55.814916Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-03T18:32:55.809211Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-03T18:32:55.813895Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":11,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Test your implementation!\n\nseq_length = 200\nfeatures = pad_features(reviews_ints, seq_length)\n\n## test statements - do not change - ##\nassert len(features)==len(reviews_ints), \"Your features should have as many rows as reviews.\"\nassert len(features[0])==seq_length, \"Each feature row should contain seq_length values.\"\n\n# print first 10 values of the first 30 batches \nprint(features[:30,:10])","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-03T18:32:55.816140Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-03T18:32:55.816693Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-03T18:32:56.931630Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-03T18:32:55.816650Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-03T18:32:56.930616Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":12,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"[[    0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0]\n [    0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0]\n [22382    42 46418    15   706 17139  3389    47    77    35]\n [ 4505   505    15     3  3342   162  8312  1652     6  4819]\n [    0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0]\n [    0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0]\n [    0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0]\n [    0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0]\n [    0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0]\n [   54    10    14   116    60   798   552    71   364     5]\n [    0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0]\n [    0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0]\n [    0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0]\n [    1   330   578    34     3   162   748  2731     9   325]\n [    9    11 10171  5305  1946   689   444    22   280   673]\n [    0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0]\n [    1   307 10399  2069  1565  6202  6528  3288 17946 10628]\n [    0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0]\n [   21   122  2069  1565   515  8181    88     6  1325  1182]\n [    1    20     6    76    40     6    58    81    95     5]\n [   54    10    84   329 26230 46427    63    10    14   614]\n [   11    20     6    30  1436 32317  3769   690 15100     6]\n [    0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0]\n [    0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0]\n [   40    26   109 17952  1422     9     1   327     4   125]\n [    0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0]\n [   10   499     1   307 10399    55    74     8    13    30]\n [    0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0]\n [    0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0]\n [    0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0]]\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Training, Validation, Test\n\nWith our data in nice shape, we'll split it into training, validation, and test sets.\n\n> **Exercise:** Create the training, validation, and test sets. \n* You'll need to create sets for the features and the labels, `train_x` and `train_y`, for example. \n* Define a split fraction, `split_frac` as the fraction of data to **keep** in the training set.

It is massively inefficient to one-hot encode that many classes. So, instead of one-hot encoding, we can have an embedding layer and use that layer as a lookup table.
